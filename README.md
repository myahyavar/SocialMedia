# SocialMedia
A simple social media app written with ASP.NET CORE + Entity Framework using Microsoft SQL Server on back-end and React.js on front-end

API does the basic CRUD stuff and a file action

Has React-Redux on login validation

Pictures are kept in server side

Login validation currently works more like registeration of user, Registeration DB and API needs to be modified a bit for a trve login validation :p
